# Introduction

This is a test of exposing the PASS data model using Elide.

It is based on https://github.com/yahoo/elide-standalone-example.

On startup tables will be created and the schema used will be written to pass.db.sql.

Look at http://localhost:8080/ to see the auto-created documentation and a UI for testing out the api.
